In this project we plot call and put options according to the Black-Scholes formalism along with two of their associated Greeks:
the theta
$\Theta_{C_0} = \frac{\partial C_0}{\partial t}$
which measures the rate of change of the option with respect to time,
and the delta
$\Delta_{C_0} = \frac{\partial C_0}{\partial S_0}$
which measures the rate of change of the option with respect to spot price.

We analyze the option prices and their sensitivities to time and spot price with some graphical visualizations,
using the explicit equations in the Black-Scholes model.
